## 🎮 Focus: Gameplay Mechanics, Stability, and Core Loop Improvements

---

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

### 🧩 Gameplay Expansion (v0.3 Progress)

- Continued building out **Coexist: The Game!** core gameplay loop
- Successfully integrated and tested:
  - `curiosity.json`
  - `temple.json`
  - `dialogue.json`
  - `conflict.json`
- Verified all encounter types are functioning:
  - Curiosity → Knowledge + Perspective
  - Temple → Deeper rewards (Harmony + Influence)
  - Dialogue → Branching outcomes (positive / tension)
  - Conflict → Resolution-based outcomes

---

### 🎯 Player Experience Improvements

- Observed and validated gameplay outcomes:
  - Loss of Influence through poor choices
  - Restoration of calm through intentional responses
  - Trade-offs between reaction vs reflection
  - Natural emergence of learning moments from conflict

- Confirmed system supports:
  - Meaningful decision-making
  - Non-linear progression
  - Emotional + strategic gameplay balance

---

### 🧠 Token System Enhancement

- Implemented **token selection system**
  - Players can now choose between:
    - Faith
    - Reason
    - Science
  - Eliminated forced selection order

- Added **TOKEN_BONUSES system**
  - Faith → +Harmony
  - Reason → +Influence
  - Science → +Curiosity

- Integrated token bonuses into:
  - Curiosity outcomes
  - Temple outcomes
  - Dialogue outcomes
  - Conflict resolution outcomes

---

### ⚔️ Conflict System Improvements

- Fixed **soft-lock issue** where player could not exit Conflict modal
- Implemented **Conflict Path penalties**
  - Lose Harmony first
  - Then lose Influence if Harmony = 0
- Added **conflict streak logic**
  - 2 consecutive Conflict Path moves → token resets to start

- Observed and confirmed:
  - Conflict now feels meaningful, not just punishing
  - Recovery through good decisions is possible

---

### 🚫 Turn System Fix (Critical)

- Identified major issue:
  - Players could continue moving after resolving encounters

- Implemented **one-move-per-turn guard**
  - Prevents additional movement after:
    - Curiosity
    - Temple
    - Dialogue
    - Conflict resolution

- Verified working behavior:
  - System now correctly enforces:
    - Move → Resolve → End Turn

---

### 🧭 Board Interaction Enhancements

- Added **move preview system**
  - Displays outcome before movement
  - Includes:
    - Harmony gain
    - Conflict penalty
    - Question prompts
    - Forum requirements

- Began implementing **hover-based preview**
  - Initial implementation in place
  - Needs further refinement

---

### 🧪 Debugging + Stability Work

- Identified critical issue:
  - Broken HTML/JS structure caused:
    - Board not rendering
    - Player panels disappearing

- Recovered by:
  - Rolling back unstable changes
  - Rebuilding working version
  - Verifying full render cycle:
    - Board
    - Scores
    - Perspective Map

- Created stable baseline moving forward

---

### 💾 Local Dev + Git Preparation

- Began setting up **local development environment**
  - Created plan for:
    - `C:\thecoexistgame` directory
    - GitHub integration

- Prepared to transition from:
  - browser-only editing  
  ➜ to  
  - local + version-controlled workflow

---

### 🌐 Domain / DNS Monitoring

- Received Proton alert:
  - “DNS issues detected for thecoexistgame.com”

- Assessed likely cause:
  - Recent domain / hosting / GitHub changes

- Determined:
  - Likely **expected behavior due to DNS updates**
  - No immediate security concern

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- The game is evolving from:
  - **movement-based system**
  ➜ into
  - **decision-based experience**

- Conflict is no longer just a penalty:
  - It is a **learning engine**

- Token identity (Faith / Reason / Science):
  - Adds meaningful strategic depth
  - Reinforces philosophical theme of the game

- Turn control is **critical to game integrity**
  - Prevents exploitation
  - Maintains pacing

---

## 🔜 Next Considerations (Not Yet Implemented)

- Refine hover preview UX
- Improve visual feedback for legal moves
- Balance reward system (Harmony vs Influence growth)
- Add stronger win-condition feedback
- Continue expanding question sets
- Transition fully to GitHub-based workflow

---

## 📊 Status

- Gameplay Loop: ✅ Functional  
- Encounters: ✅ Integrated  
- Token System: ✅ Working  
- Conflict System: ✅ Stable  
- Turn Logic: ✅ Fixed  
- UI Stability: ⚠️ Recently Recovered (Stable Baseline)  
- Dev Environment: 🔄 In Progress  

---

## 🧭 Summary

Today marked a major transition from **prototype mechanics** to a **functioning game system**.

Core pillars now in place:
- Movement
- Choice
- Consequence
- Recovery
- Strategy

The foundation for **Coexist: The Game!** is now real and playable.
